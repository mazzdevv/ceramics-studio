									<h3 id="memberships">Memberships for everyone.</h3>
									<p>We understand that financial circumstances vary greatly among individuals. To make our studio accessible, we offer a sliding scale membership option. In addition to our standard membership plans, we offer a pay-per-use model for those who prefer a more flexible approach. This model allows individuals to utilize our studio facilities and services on a per-session basis. Instead of committing to a long-term membership, you have the freedom to visit the studio and pay for the specific services or studio time you require. This option is ideal for those who have irregular schedules or are unable to make a long-term commitment.</p>
									<p>Our sliding scale ranges from $30 to $150 a month. It is up to you and how much you can afford and how much time you want to spend at the studio.</p>
									<p>Our commitment to inclusivity extends beyond membership plans. We actively seek partnerships with local organizations, businesses, and sponsors who share our vision of making ceramics accessible. Through these collaborations, we can offer community initiatives such as subsidized workshops, free events, and outreach programs.</p>
									<h3 id="courses">Courses for all levels and interests.</h3>
									<p>Our volunteer-led courses are a testament to the dedication and generosity of our community members. These individuals, who are experienced ceramic artists and passionate about teaching, offer their time and expertise to create enriching learning experiences for others. By volunteering as instructors, they share their knowledge, skills, and passion with aspiring artists, providing valuable guidance and support.</p>
									<p>We firmly believe that financial constraints should never hinder someone's artistic growth. That's why we offer pay-what-you-can courses. These courses allow participants to determine the value of the instruction received and make a financial contribution that is meaningful and affordable to them.</p>
									<h3 id="workshops">Unique and creative workshops.</h3>
									<p>One off workshops are taught throughout the week by volunteer members of the community hoping to give back to their peers. These are always donation based and full of surprises! We have had workshops range from "Meditative Sculpting" to "Bob Ross Inspired Glazing" to "How To Give Your Pot More Personality." See our <a href="right-sidebar.html">calendar of events</a> page to see what we have coming up!</p>
									<h3 id="events">Events for connecting the community.</h3>
									<p>Each month we host a community event that isn't focused on getting behind the wheel. Building community is essential for the growth of new ideas and nurturing creativity within eachother and with eachother. We have painted murals, done potlucks, and even brought in local musicians for a dance night! We love making new connections at Our Studio.</p>
									<h3 id="markets">Independent artist markets.</h3>
									<p>Another monthly event that we host is a little market for our community members to shop, sell, and trade our unique creations. We encourage the appreciation of the inherent (non-monetary) value of the ceramics that we make, but we also encourage the supporting of other artists and the value of a unique piece made by a friend.</p>
